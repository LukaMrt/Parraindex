## About the project

a

This project is a school project made for the third semester of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the
University of Lyon 1. The objective of this project is to create a web application with a visual interface and
an administration interface used to manage the application.

We decided to create a website which presents the relationship existing between students of the Institute of
Technology. There are many sponsor relationships between students, and we wanted to create a website that would
allow students to see all the links between people.

## Built with

The school imposed to not use any framework, so we decided to use the following technologies to create the website:

* Twig for front-end
* SCSS for styling
* JavaScript for front-end interactions
* PHP with some libraries for back-end
* MariaDB for database

## Installation

To launch the project, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

* PHP
* MariaDB
* Composer
* SCSS

### Launching the project

To launch the project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `composer install`
3. Create a database and import the `creation.sql` file located in the `database` folder
4. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project and fill it with the following information (follow the
   example of the `.env.example` file):

    ```

    DRIVER="mysql"              # Database driver (mysql, pgsql, sqlite, ...)
    HOST="host"                 # Host of the database
    PORT="3306"                 # Port of the database (default: 3306)
    DATABASE="database"         # Name of the database
    USERNAME="user"             # Username of the database
    PASSWORD="password"         # Password of the database
    
    # Mail
    
    MAIL_USERNAME="username"   # Username of the mail account
    MAIL_PASSWORD="password"   # Password of the mail account
    MAIL_HOST="host"           # Host of the mail account
    MAIL_PORT="587"            # Port of the mail account (default: 587)
